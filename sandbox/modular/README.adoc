= modular sandbox

This project provides a sandbox for programming a modular application.

Feel free to mess with `module-32` or `module-64`!

You can run this code in QEMU from the root directory with:

`./gradlew :sandbox:modular:run-image`

Look for output in QEMU debugcon console!

== machine

Module entry point procedures are called with the machine in the following state:

- long mode
- flat segments
- 4 KiB stack
- ignored interrupts
- identity-mapped paging

ELF32 modules will be called in a 32-bit code segment, ELF64 modules in a 64-bit code segment.

== start

Start code is located in `start`.

It prepares the machine by activating long mode.

With the machine ready, it locates all modules, and far calls into the module in the appropriate code segment.
