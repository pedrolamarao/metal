= x86-32 sandbox

This project provides a sandbox for programming x86 in protected mode.

Look for the `psys::sandbox` procedure in `sandbox.cpp`!

You can run this code in QEMU from the root directory with:

`./gradlew :sandbox:x86-32:run-image`

Look for output in the "debugcon console"!

== debugging

QEMU will listen for a GDB remote serial protocol client at `tcp:localhost:12345`.

In order to give time for the debugger to connect, you must instruct QEMU to wait.

In the `build.gradle.kts` file, look for `qemuArgs.stop.set(false)`.

If you change that value to `true`, QEMU will immediately pause after starting.
