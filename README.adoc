== summary

Welcome to project Metal!

Metal is a research project on "bare metal" software engineering.

For more information on this project's mission, ambitions and aims, see link:doc/GOAL.adoc[GOAL].

== prepare

Metal is built with an LLVM based toolset.

JDK 17 or newer is required in either environment `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH`.

The following tools are required in gradle property `metal.path` or environment `PATH`.

- CMake 3
- GNU grub 2
- LLVM 16 or newer
- Ninja
- QEMU 6.0 up to 7.2

For more information, see link:doc/TOOLS.adoc[TOOLS].

== build

Metal is built by link:https://github.com/pedrolamarao/gradle-metal[Gradle Metal].

To assemble everything for host: `./gradlew build`
This task shall compile and run modules and unit test programs.

To assemble everything for target `i686-elf`: `./gradlew build -Pmetal.target=i686-elf`
This task shall compile and run modules and QEMU emulated system test programs.

Currently, only targets host and `i686-elf` are supported.
We expect to include target `x86_64-elf` very soon.

To clean everything: `./gradlew clean`

== verify

Metal is verified by automated tests.

For more information, see link:doc/TEST.adoc[TEST].

The `check` task runs all verifications, and the `test` task runs test programs.
