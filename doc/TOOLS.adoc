= project metal: tools
:author: Pedro Lamar√£o <pedro.lamarao@gmail.com>

The Gradle Metal driver requires a JDK 17 in either `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH`.
It is an application of the link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle[Gradle] build tool.

Generally, tools will be found in the system `PATH`.
This may be replaced with a custom tools path in gradle property `metal.path`.
To set Gradle properties, look link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html[here].

For assembling main components, LLVM is required.
Versions 16 and 17 are known to work.
Metal employs LLVM's cross-compilation capabilities.

For assembling Multiboot2 system test programs, GNU GRUB 2 is required.
Currently, Metal creates "standalone" images for test programs.

For running system test programs, QEMU is required.
Versions from 6.0 up to 7.2 are known to work.
Versions 8.0 or more recent are known to *not* work.
For more information, see link:TEST.adoc[TEST].

Windows 10 and 11 are known to work.
