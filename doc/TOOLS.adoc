= metal: tools
:author: Pedro Lamar√£o <pedro.lamarao@gmail.com>

The Gradle Metal driver requires a JDK 17 in either `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH`.
It is an application of the link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle[Gradle] build tool.

Generally, tools will be found in the system `PATH`.
This may be replaced with a custom tools path in gradle property `metal.path`.
To set Gradle properties, look link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html[here].

For assembling main components, LLVM 16 or newer is required.
Metal employs LLVM's cross-compilation capabilities.

For assembling Multiboot2 system test programs, GNU GRUB 2 is required.
Currently, Metal creates "standalone" images for test programs.

For running system test programs, QEMU 6.0 exactly is required.
For more information, see link:TEST.adoc[TEST].

Windows 10 and 11 have been verified to work.
