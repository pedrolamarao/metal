= project metal: goal
:author: Pedro Lamar√£o <pedro.lamarao@gmail.com>

The project's primary goal is to investigate the impact of state-of-the-art tools and practices in
crafting software for the "bare metal".

The "bare metal" is perceived to be a very difficult tool to master. From our experience programming
the "bare system" with native tools emerged the following intuition: that a significant part of this
difficulty derives from poor tools and practices inducing a high cost to important engineering
techniques such as modularization and refactoring.

One of this project's goals is to enable such techniques. According to our intuition, the use of
appropriate tools and practices leads to low cost in the application of such techniques, therefore
enabling their use in practice. On the other hand, the use of inappropriate tools and practices
lead to a high cost in the application of such techniques, discouraging their use in practice.

The first technique we aim to enable is that of architecture rearrangement and refactoring. Since
time immemorial, native tools have been capable of producing reusable components, such as "objects"
and "libraries". However, in the configuration of a user component, native tools have generally
required the manual configuration of every dependant component on such things as "include paths".
The cost of doing this escalates in the presence of transitive dependencies. We believe that this
cost has induced the high rejection of modularity, which manifests in a "no dependencies" philosophy. 

Our aim is therefore to obtain an architecture where, in practice, to add or remove a dependency
relation requires modifying a single line of configuration, such as `B dependsOn A`. The tools
must resolve all that is necessary to configure everything accordingly.

We expect that easy architecture rearrangement and refactoring will lead to more architecture
experimentation, which in turn will lead to better components.

The second technique we aim to enable is that of automated testing. Currently, there are appropriate
frameworks for automated testing of native programs in most development environments. However,
in the particular case of the "bare metal", this is not the case. Observing program execution
in the "bare metal" is very difficult and requires specialized hardware. Even with system
emulators, observing program execution is not particularly easy. We believe this difficulty
induces a high rejection to automated testing in favor of `printf` testing over data ports.

Our aim is therefore to obtain a technique complementary to unit testing capable of automated
testing of "bare metal" test programs. The tools must observe program execution and make accurate
reports on test success or failure. The technique is allowed to require specialized debugger
support in hardware or system emulator.

The third technique we aim to enable is that of cross development. Since time immemorial, there
have been native tools capable of producing programs for "cross targets". However, to this day,
actually obtaining these tools has been difficult, even in the case of free software tools. We
believe this difficulty induces projects to reuse whatever tool is available at the moment with
no consideration to appropriateness, usability or other factors.

Our aim is therefore to obtain a technique capable of easy "cross development", such that users
may work on highly usable environments producing programs for whatever appropriate targets.
